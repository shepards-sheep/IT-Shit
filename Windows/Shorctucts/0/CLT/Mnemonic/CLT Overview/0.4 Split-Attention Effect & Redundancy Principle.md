- **C**ombine – Integrate related information (e.g., placing text close to relevant images).
    
- **L**imit – Avoid unnecessary repetition that overloads working memory.
    
- **E**mphasize – Highlight key points instead of presenting everything at once.
    
- **A**lign – Ensure text, visuals, and spoken words work together seamlessly.

### Examples:
#### **1. Cooking with a Badly Designed Recipe**

Imagine you're following a recipe where the ingredient list is on one page, the instructions are on another, and a separate video demonstrates the process without captions. You constantly switch between sources, making the process frustrating and slow.

**Better Design**: A well-structured recipe places ingredients next to the steps they are used in, reducing unnecessary back-and-forth and improving comprehension.

#### **2. Learning to Drive with Overloaded Instructions**

A driving instructor explains every detail—gear shifts, turn signals, road signs—while also handing you a manual to read at the same time. Instead of learning smoothly, you're overwhelmed by redundant and split attention.

**Better Design**: The instructor explains key actions in the moment while demonstrating them visually, allowing you to focus on the road and learn progressively.

Both effects highlight how **instructional design impacts cognitive load**. Poor design forces learners to split their focus or process unnecessary information, slowing learning. Effective design **integrates information in a clear, structured way**, ensuring learners engage with essential content without distraction.
