### **Mnemonic for Working Memory: FOCUS**

_(Because working memory is limited, staying focused helps maximize its efficiency.)_

1. **Filter Distractions** – Remove unnecessary information to prevent overload.
    
2. **Organize Information** – Use lists, categories, or steps to structure what you’re processing.
    
3. **Chunk Content** – Break down complex data into smaller, manageable pieces.
    
4. **Use Repetition** – Rehearse information to keep it active in memory.
    
5. **Simplify Tasks** – Reduce multitasking to prevent excessive cognitive load.

By focusing on each step and managing distractions, your working memory can handle the new information without getting overwhelmed.

### **Mnemonic for Long-Term Memory: STORE**

_(Because long-term memory is like a storage system that needs proper organization.)_

1. **Structure Knowledge** – Organize related ideas into meaningful categories (schemas).
    
2. **Tie to Prior Learning** – Connect new information to what you already know.
    
3. **Optimize Recall** – Use active recall techniques like self-testing.
    
4. **Reinforce Over Time** – Space out review sessions to strengthen retention.
