**How learners encode, store, and retrieve information.**  
Memory plays a crucial role in learning retention and the ability to apply knowledge. Understanding how information moves through different memory stages helps optimize learning.

### **Breakdown:**

- **Encoding** – Converting new information into memory.
    
- **Storage** – Maintaining information over time.
    
- **Retrieval** – Accessing stored knowledge when needed.
