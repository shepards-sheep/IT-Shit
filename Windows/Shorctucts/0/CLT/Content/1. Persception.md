**How learners interpret and engage with information.**  
Perception plays a major role in how students **filter, organize, and give meaning** to knowledge. It influences how we focus on relevant details and ignore distractions, shaping how effectively we learn.

### Breakdown:  

- **Top-Down Processing** – Interpretation based on prior knowledge, experiences, and expectations.  
- **Bottom-Up Processing** – Data-driven perception based purely on sensory input.  
- **Selective Attention** – Filtering out distractions to focus on learning.
