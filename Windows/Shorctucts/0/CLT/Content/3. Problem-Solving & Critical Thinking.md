**How learners analyze information, evaluate solutions, and make decisions.**  
Problem-solving and critical thinking help learners **identify issues, assess information, and apply logical reasoning** to find solutions.

### **Breakdown:**

- **Analytical Thinking** – Breaking down problems into smaller parts for better understanding.
    
- **Divergent Thinking** "***Brainstorming***" – Exploring multiple solutions and creative approaches.
    
- **Convergent Thinking** – Narrowing down options to find the most effective solution.
    
- **Metacognition** – Thinking about one's own thinking process to improve problem-solving strategies.
